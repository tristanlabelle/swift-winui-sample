    /// The map of qualifiers used to map a qualifier name to a qualifier value. The qualifier value returned represents the current setting. Here is a reference table of all the possible qualifier values that can be returned. See Tailor your resources for language, scale, high contrast, and other qualifiers for an explanation of the general concept of qualifiers, how to use them, and the purpose of each of the qualifier names.

    /// | Qualifier name                | Qualifier values |
    /// |-------------------------------|------------------|
    /// | alternateform, or altform     | A string, between 1 and 16 chars in length, representing an alternate form of a resource. |
    /// | configuration, or configA     | string. Matches the value of the MS_CONFIGURATION_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE environment variable. It's unlikely that you'll need to use this qualifier name (see the Configuration section of Tailor your resources for language, scale, high contrast, and other qualifiers). |
    /// | contrast                      | Either standard (the default; matches high contrast off), high (matches any high contrast setting), black (matches High Contrast Black, High Contrast #1, and High Contrast #2), or white (matches High Contrast White). |
    /// | custom                        | A custom value. |
    /// | devicefamily                  | It's unlikely that you'll need to use this qualifier name (see the DeviceFamily section of Tailor your resources for language, scale, high contrast, and other qualifiers). |
    /// | dxfeaturelevel, or dxfl       | Either DX9, DX10, DX11, or DX12. This qualifier has been deprecated. See the DXFeatureLevel section of Tailor your resources for language, scale, high contrast, and other qualifiers. |
    /// | homeregion                    | Any valid BCP-47 region tag (such as us, or 840). That is, any ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 two-letter region code, plus the set of ISO 3166-1 numeric three-digit geographic codes for composed regions (see United Nations Statistic Division M49 composition of region codes). Matches the country or region setting. |
    /// | language, or lang             | Any valid BCP-47 language tag (such as en, or en-US). Matches the display language setting. For a list of languages, see the IANA language subtag registry. |
    /// | layoutdirection, or layoutdir | Either LTR (left-to-right), RTL (right-to-left), TTBLTR (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), or TTBRTL (top-to-bottom, right-to-left). Matches the layout direction of the display language setting. |
    /// | scale                         | Either 80, 100 (default), 120, 125, 140, 150, 160, 175, 180, 200, 225, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 450. Matches the display scale setting. The values 125, 150, 175, 225, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 were introduced in Windows 10. |
    /// | targetsize                    | A positive integer that represents the side length of a square image in raw (physical) pixels. Matches the View setting in File Explorer. |
    /// | theme                         | Either dark or light. Matches the default or overridden app mode setting.|
